# Guess The Number
🎯Guess the Number (Java Console Game)
A fun number-guessing game built using Java.
The computer randomly picks a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it in as few attempts as possible.
After each guess, the program gives hints like “Too high” or “Too low” until the player finds the correct number.
